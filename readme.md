#Summary:

1.We created an ecommerce database and tables (customers, orders, products, and order_items).

2.We inserted sample data into the tables.

3.We provided SQL queries for various tasks, including retrieving customer orders, updating product prices, and normalizing the database for better data management.

#This setup provides a foundation for managing a simple e-commerce system.
